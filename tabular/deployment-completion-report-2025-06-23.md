- `networking-stack.yaml` - VPC, subnets, ALB
- `security-stack.yaml` - IAM roles, KMS, secrets
- `storage-stack.yaml` - S3, DynamoDB, RDS, ElastiCache
- `compute-stack.yaml` - ECS, Auto Scaling, Lambda
- `monitoring-stack.yaml` - CloudWatch, X-Ray, alerts

### CDK (AWS)
- Python-based CDK application
- Modular stack design
- Environment-specific deployments
- Complete configuration in `cdk.json`

## Architecture Documentation

Created comprehensive AWS deployment architecture documentation:
- Visual diagrams using Mermaid
- Component architecture details
- Deployment flows
- Security architecture
- Cost optimization features
- High availability design
- Best practices guide

## Key Improvements

1. **Multi-Service Support**: AWS now supports EC2, ECS, Fargate, EKS, Lambda, and Batch
2. **Enhanced Security**: IAM roles, KMS encryption, Secrets Manager integration
3. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, X-Ray tracing
4. **Cost Management**: Accurate cost estimation for all services
5. **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployments, auto-scaling, health checks

## Testing Coverage

All new AWS features include:
- Provider method implementations
- CLI command handlers
- Service-specific deployment logic
- Error handling and rollback capabilities
- Cost estimation accuracy

## Production Readiness
