## Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Security First**
   - Implement API authentication
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Set up basic rate limiting

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Run existing tests and fix any failures
   - Add missing integration tests
   - Set up CI pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Create basic API documentation
   - Update README with better examples
   - Add troubleshooting section

4. **Performance**
   - Implement basic streaming for large files
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets

## Notes

- Current test coverage is estimated at ~60-70%, target should be >90%
- The infrastructure module is over-engineered for current needs - consider simplifying
- CTGAN implementation was missing (now fixed) - verify all generators work correctly
- Consider adding health metrics endpoint for production monitoring
- Need to establish SLAs for API response times
- Memory usage optimization is critical for large dataset handling

## Infrastructure Architecture Notes

The proposed infrastructure architecture should follow these principles:

1. **Provider Abstraction**: All cloud-specific implementations should inherit from common abstract base classes
2. **Consistent APIs**: Same methods and parameters across all providers for similar resources
3. **Feature Parity**: Document which features are available on which providers
4. **Configuration as Code**: All deployments should be reproducible from configuration files
5. **Provider Detection**: Automatically detect and use appropriate provider based on environment
