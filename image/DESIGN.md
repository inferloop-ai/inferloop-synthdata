Real-time Generation: Sub-second latency for streaming use cases
Batch Processing: Efficient handling of large-scale generation
Resource Optimization: Memory and compute efficiency
Auto-scaling: Kubernetes-based horizontal pod autoscaling

üõ† Usage Examples
Quick Start - SDK

from audio_synth.sdk.client import AudioSynthSDK

# Initialize SDK
sdk = AudioSynthSDK()

# Generate and validate audio
result = sdk.generate_and_validate(
    method="diffusion",
    prompt="Professional business presentation",
    num_samples=5,
    validators=["quality", "privacy", "fairness"]
)

# Access results
audios = result["audios"]
quality_scores = result["validation"]["quality"]

CLI Usage

# Generate audio samples
audio-synth generate \
    --method diffusion \
    --prompt "Customer service greeting" \
    --num-samples 10 \
    --privacy-level high \
    --output-dir ./output

# Validate existing audio
audio-synth validate \
    --input-dir ./audio_samples \
    --validators quality privacy fairness \
    --generate-report
    

Real-time Streaming

from audio_synth.streaming.realtime_engine import RealTimeAudioEngine

# Start streaming engine
engine = RealTimeAudioEngine()

# WebSocket server for real-time generation
ws_server = WebSocketStreamingServer(engine, port=8765)

Real-time Streaming
from audio_synth.streaming.realtime_engine import RealTimeAudioEngine

# Start streaming engine
