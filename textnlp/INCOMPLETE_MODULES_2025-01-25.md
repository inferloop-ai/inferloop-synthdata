    """Manages GPU resources across cloud providers"""
    # TBD: Implementation needed
```

### 2. Model Storage Optimization (1 week - High Priority)
**Status: TBD**
- Model sharding for models > 10GB
- Chunked upload/download for large files
- Model versioning system
- Delta updates for model weights

**Storage Hierarchy:**
```yaml
model_storage:
  hot_tier:  # Frequently accessed models - TBD
  warm_tier: # Less frequent models - TBD
  cold_tier: # Archived models - TBD
```

### 3. Inference Endpoints (2 weeks - High Priority)
**Status: TBD**
- Model serving API endpoints
- Request batching implementation
- Model warm-up procedures
- Load balancing for inference

**Endpoint Structure:**
```python
class ModelServingEndpoint:
    """Configures model serving endpoints"""
    # TBD: Implementation needed
```

### 4. NLP Metrics Collection (1 week - Medium Priority)
**Status: TBD**
- Generation metrics (tokens/sec, time to first token)
- Quality metrics (perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, semantic similarity)
- Resource metrics (GPU usage, cache hit rate, batch efficiency)
- Business metrics (cost per 1k tokens, API calls per model)

**Metrics to Implement:**
```python
class NLPMetricsCollector:
    """Collects NLP-specific performance metrics"""
    # TBD: Implementation needed
```

### 5. Content Filtering Pipeline (1 week - High Priority)
**Status: TBD**
- PII detection implementation (names, addresses, SSN, etc.)
- Toxicity classification
- Bias detection algorithms
- Compliance checking (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
- Audit logging for filtered content

**Pipeline Structure:**
```python
class ContentFilterPipeline:
    """Filters generated content for safety and compliance"""
    # TBD: Implementation needed
```

## Implementation Timeline

| Component | Estimated Time | Priority | Status |
|-----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| GPU Resource Management | 1 week | High | TBD |
| Model Storage Optimization | 1 week | High | TBD |
| Inference Endpoints | 2 weeks | High | TBD |
| NLP Metrics | 1 week | Medium | TBD |
| Content Filtering | 1 week | High | TBD |
| **Total** | **6 weeks** | - | **0% Complete** |

## Integration Points
These components will integrate with existing tabular infrastructure:

1. **GPU Management** → Extends existing compute providers
2. **Model Storage** → Uses unified storage abstraction with NLP optimizations
3. **Inference Endpoints** → Leverages existing API gateway and load balancing
4. **NLP Metrics** → Extends monitoring framework with custom collectors
5. **Content Filtering** → Integrates with security and compliance modules

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize GPU Resource Management implementation
2. Begin Model Storage Optimization in parallel
3. Design Inference Endpoints architecture
4. Plan NLP Metrics integration with existing monitoring
5. Develop Content Filtering requirements with legal/compliance team

## Notes
- All incomplete modules are specific to NLP/text generation requirements
- The base infrastructure from tabular is 95% complete and can be leveraged
- GPU support is critical for most TextNLP functionality
- Content filtering is essential for production deployment
- Total estimated completion time: 6 weeks with proper resource allocation
