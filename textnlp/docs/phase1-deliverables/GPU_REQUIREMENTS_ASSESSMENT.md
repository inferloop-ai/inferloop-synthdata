    "model-name",
    device_map="auto",  # Automatic model parallelism
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
)
```

# Mixed precision training
from transformers import TrainingArguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    fp16=True,
    dataloader_pin_memory=False,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4
)

# Dynamic batching for inference
import torch
def dynamic_batch_inference(prompts, max_batch_size=32):
    batches = [prompts[i:i+max_batch_size] 
              for i in range(0, len(prompts), max_batch_size)]
