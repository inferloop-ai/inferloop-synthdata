## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Cloud GPU Management
```python
# Example usage
manager = GPUResourceManager()
manager.register_provider("aws", "us-east-1")
manager.register_provider("gcp", "us-central1")
manager.register_provider("azure", "eastus")

# Get GPU instance recommendation
instance = manager.get_gpu_instance("aws", GPUType.NVIDIA_T4, count=2)
```

### 2. Health Monitoring System
```python
# Example monitoring setup
monitor = AWSGPUHealthMonitor(cloudwatch_client, ec2_client)
health_check = await monitor.monitor_gpu("i-1234567890")
```

### 3. Autoscaling Configuration
```python
# Example autoscaling policy
policy = ScalingPolicy(
    min_instances=1,
    max_instances=10,
    target_utilization=70.0,
    cost_aware=True,
    spot_instance_ratio=0.7
)
```

### 4. CUDA Environment Management
```python
# Example CUDA validation
manager = CUDASetupManager()
validation = manager.validate_environment("pytorch")
```
