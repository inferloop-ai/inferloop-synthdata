    async def track_usage(self, tenant_id: str, service: str, metric: str, amount: int):
        # Real-time tracking
        key = f"usage:{tenant_id}:{service}:{metric}:{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m')}"
        await self.redis.incrby(key, amount)
        
        # Check limits

        if current_usage > limits.get(metric, float('inf')):
            raise UsageLimitExceeded(f"Limit exceeded for {metric}")
            
        # Send to billing
        await self.billing.record_usage(
            tenant_id=tenant_id,
            service=service,
            metric=metric,
