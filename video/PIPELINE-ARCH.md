    "demographic_balancing": True,
    "consent_framework": "synthetic_only",
    "data_retention": "configurable",
    "export_controls": "automated"
}

Technical Differentiators

Multi-Engine Support: Unreal/Unity/Omniverse provides flexibility for different quality/performance requirements
Real-time Validation: Immediate quality feedback prevents poor training data
Scalable Architecture: Kubernetes-based deployment supports high-throughput generation
Integration Ecosystem: ROS, Kafka, and robotics SDK integration for seamless workflow

This video synthesis capability, combined with your enterprise MCP framework, creates a powerful platform for generating high-quality training data across multiple AI domains while maintaining strict quality and privacy standards.
