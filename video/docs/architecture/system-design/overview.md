# System Architecture Overview

## High-Level Architecture

The Enterprise Video Synthesis Pipeline consists of six core microservices orchestrated to provide end-to-end video generation capabilities:

### Core Services

1. **Orchestration Service** (Port 8080)
   - Coordinates the entire pipeline workflow
   - Manages inter-service communication
   - Provides main API gateway functionality
   - Handles pipeline status and monitoring

2. **Ingestion Service** (Port 8081)
   - Scrapes video data from web sources
   - Handles API integrations (Kaggle, AWS Open Data)
   - Processes file uploads
   - Manages streaming data capture

3. **Metrics Extraction Service** (Port 8082)
   - Analyzes real-world video quality
   - Extracts object detection benchmarks
   - Calculates motion and temporal metrics
   - Provides baseline quality standards

4. **Generation Service** (Port 8083)
   - Integrates with Unreal Engine, Unity, Omniverse
   - Generates synthetic video content
   - Applies real-world parameter optimization
   - Manages rendering pipelines

5. **Validation Service** (Port 8084)
   - Validates synthetic content against real-world metrics
   - Performs quality assurance testing
   - Checks compliance requirements
   - Generates improvement recommendations

6. **Delivery Service** (Port 8085)
   - Provides multiple access methods (REST, streaming, SDKs)
   - Manages content distribution
   - Handles customer authentication
   - Implements rate limiting and quotas

### Data Flow

```
Real-world Data → Ingestion → Metrics Extraction → Generation → Validation → Delivery
                                    ↓
                            Quality Benchmarks ← → Synthetic Video
```

### Infrastructure Components

- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata and configuration storage
- **MinIO**: Object storage for video files
- **Kafka**: Event streaming and messaging
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Monitoring dashboards

### Quality Assurance

The pipeline implements a rigorous quality framework:

- **Real-world Baseline**: Extract metrics from authentic video data
- **Multi-dimensional Validation**: Quality, content, compliance, performance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time quality tracking
- **Adaptive Improvement**: Automatic parameter optimization

### Scalability Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent scaling and deployment
- **Event-driven Processing**: Asynchronous pipeline execution
- **Cloud-native Design**: Kubernetes-ready containerization
- **Multi-cloud Support**: AWS, GCP, Azure compatibility

### Security & Compliance

- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in GDPR compliance
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end security
