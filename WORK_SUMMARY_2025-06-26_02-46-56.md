## Documentation Analysis Sources

The following existing documentation was analyzed to create the new guides:

1. **TextNLP Documentation**:
   - `ON_PREMISE_HOSTING_GUIDE.md`
   - `LOCALHOST_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
   - `AIR_GAPPED_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - `SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md`
   - `MONITORING_AND_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md`

2. **Analysis Method**:
   - Extracted infrastructure requirements
   - Identified security configurations
   - Mapped development to production progression
   - Compiled monitoring and compliance requirements

## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Create unified infrastructure library shared between Tabular and TextNLP
2. Start with AWS provider implementation (Week 1)
3. Implement authentication system using Tabular's patterns

### Short-term Goals (1-2 months)
1. Achieve infrastructure feature parity with Tabular
2. Complete test coverage to >80%
3. Deploy production pilot with GPU support

### Long-term Vision (3-6 months)
1. Merge common infrastructure into shared library
2. Optimize for NLP-specific workloads
3. Build advanced NLP features on solid foundation

## Technical Highlights

### Code Reuse Strategy
```python
# Example: Extending Tabular's AWS provider for TextNLP
from tabular.deploy.aws import AWSProvider as TabularAWSProvider

class TextNLPAWSProvider(TabularAWSProvider):
    """AWS provider extended for NLP workloads"""
    
    GPU_INSTANCE_TYPES = {
        'small': 'g4dn.xlarge',      # 1x T4 GPU
        'medium': 'g4dn.2xlarge',    # 1x T4 GPU, more CPU
        'large': 'p3.2xlarge',       # 1x V100 GPU
        'xlarge': 'p4d.24xlarge'     # 8x A100 GPU
    }
```

### Database Schema for TextNLP
```sql
CREATE TABLE models (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    version VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    size_bytes BIGINT,
    gpu_memory_required INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(name, version)
);
```

### 4. Data Capture Framework Implementation Plan
**File Created**: `DATA_CAPTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2025-06-26_03-48-40.md`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive plan for implementing universal data capture framework to address the gaps identified in both Tabular and TextNLP modules.

**Key Components**:
1. **Architecture Design**
   - Universal Data Capture Framework
   - Multi-modal capture engines (API, Stream, File, Database, Financial, NLP)
   - Processing pipeline with compliance and privacy
   - Scalable storage and metadata layer

2. **Implementation Timeline**: 8-week plan
   - Weeks 1-2: Foundation (core framework, compliance, rate limiting)
   - Weeks 3-4: Financial Integration (SEC EDGAR, market data, NLP sources)
   - Weeks 5-6: Characterization & Feature Extraction
   - Week 7: Integration & Testing
   - Week 8: Deployment & Optimization

3. **Resource Requirements**
   - Team: 3-4 developers (Tech Lead, 2 Backend Engineers, 1 Data Engineer, 0.5 DevOps)
   - Infrastructure: Development → Staging → Production scaling

4. **Technology Stack**
   - Orchestration: Apache Airflow
   - Streaming: Apache Kafka
   - Processing: Apache Spark, Dask
   - Privacy: Opacus, SmartNoise
   - Storage: Apache Iceberg, Parquet

5. **Success Metrics**
   - 542 sources integrated
   - >95% capture success rate
   - <5min processing latency
   - >90% data quality score
   - 100% privacy compliance

**Critical Integrations**:
- SEC EDGAR bulk downloads and API
- Financial market data (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Polygon)
- NLP datasets (Banking77, MultiWOZ, financial news)
- Academic portals (Kaggle, HuggingFace)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Robust rate limiting for API compliance
- Privacy-by-design approach
- Horizontal scaling architecture
- Automated compliance checking

This implementation plan directly addresses the data capture gaps identified in the earlier analysis, providing the missing layer needed to connect Inferloop Synthdata to real-world data sources for high-quality synthetic data generation.
