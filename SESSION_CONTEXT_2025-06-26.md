### Current TextNLP Gaps (Priority Order)

#### 1. Critical Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)
- [ ] Cloud provider implementations (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem)
- [ ] API middleware layer (auth, rate limiting, error handling)
- [ ] Database schema and migrations
- [ ] Base test framework

#### 2. Testing & Quality (Weeks 4-5)
- [ ] Unit test suite (target: >80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests
- [ ] Load testing framework
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

#### 3. Operations & Monitoring (Weeks 6-7)
- [ ] Operations runbooks
- [ ] NLP-specific metrics collectors
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Alerting configuration

#### 4. Enterprise Features (Weeks 8-9)
- [ ] Authentication system (JWT + API keys)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy support
- [ ] Advanced caching layer
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Key Code Patterns to Follow

#### 1. Provider Extension Pattern
```python
# Extend Tabular's providers for TextNLP
from tabular.deploy.aws import AWSProvider as TabularAWSProvider

class TextNLPAWSProvider(TabularAWSProvider):
    """Add NLP-specific features"""
    # GPU management
    # Model storage
    # Inference endpoints
```

#### 2. Middleware Reuse Pattern
```python
# Reuse Tabular's middleware
from tabular.api.middleware import SecurityMiddleware, RateLimiter
# Extend with NLP-specific features
```

#### 3. Test Framework Inheritance
```python
# Inherit Tabular's test utilities
from tabular.tests.base import BaseAPITest
# Add NLP-specific test cases
```

### Environment Variables and Configuration

#### Current Configuration Files
- `textnlp/config/deployment.yaml` - Basic deployment config
- `textnlp/deployment-config.yaml` - Service configuration
- Various cloud-specific configs in phase deliverables

#### Needed Configurations
1. Database connection strings
2. Cloud provider credentials
3. GPU allocation policies
4. Model storage locations
5. API rate limits
6. Authentication secrets

### Dependencies to Review

#### TextNLP Specific
- PyTorch/TensorFlow for model inference
- Transformers library
- CUDA dependencies for GPU
- Model optimization libraries (ONNX, TensorRT)

#### From Tabular (to reuse)
- Cloud provider SDKs (boto3, google-cloud, azure)
- Kubernetes client
- Database drivers (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Monitoring libraries (Prometheus client)

### Tomorrow's Starting Points

#### Option 1: Start Infrastructure (Recommended)
1. Create `textnlp/deploy/` directory structure
2. Copy and adapt `tabular/deploy/base.py`
3. Implement first cloud provider (AWS recommended)
4. Test GPU instance creation

#### Option 2: Start with API Middleware
1. Create `textnlp/api/middleware/` directory
2. Copy and adapt Tabular's middleware
3. Implement authentication first
4. Add rate limiting

#### Option 3: Start with Testing
1. Set up test framework structure
2. Create base test classes
3. Write tests for existing code
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline

### Important Files to Reference

#### From Tabular (for patterns)
- `tabular/deploy/base.py` - Base provider class
- `tabular/api/middleware/security_middleware.py` - Security patterns
- `tabular/api/auth/auth_handler.py` - Authentication patterns
- `tabular/tests/conftest.py` - Test fixtures

#### From TextNLP (current implementation)
- `textnlp/sdk/base_generator.py` - Core abstraction
- `textnlp/api/app.py` - Current API setup
- `textnlp/CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines

### Git Status for Tomorrow
- All work committed
- Ready to start implementation
- No uncommitted changes

### Questions to Resolve
1. Which cloud provider to implement first? (Recommend: AWS)
2. Should we create a shared infrastructure library?
3. What's the priority: infrastructure or testing?
4. Do we need to maintain backward compatibility?

### Success Metrics to Track
- [ ] Infrastructure code coverage: 0% → 95%
- [ ] Test coverage: ~20% → 80%+
- [ ] API feature parity: 0% → 100%
- [ ] Documentation updates: As we go
- [ ] Security compliance: Maintain standards

### Contact/Resources
