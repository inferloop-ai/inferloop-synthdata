from tabular.deploy.base import BaseProvider
from tabular.deploy.aws import AWSProvider

class TextNLPAWSProvider(AWSProvider):
    """Extend Tabular's AWS provider for NLP-specific needs"""
    
    def create_gpu_instances(self, instance_type: str, count: int):
        """Add GPU instance management"""
        # Implementation here
        
    def setup_model_storage(self, bucket_name: str):
        """Configure S3 for large model storage"""
        # Implementation here
```

### 2. API Architecture Adoption
```python
# Reuse Tabular's middleware architecture
from tabular.api.middleware import SecurityMiddleware, RateLimiter
from textnlp.api.app import app

# Apply Tabular's middleware to TextNLP
app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware)
app.add_middleware(RateLimiter, calls=1000, period=3600)
```

### 3. Testing Framework Reuse
```python
# Adapt Tabular's test structure
from tabular.tests.base import BaseAPITest

class TextNLPAPITest(BaseAPITest):
    """Inherit Tabular's test utilities"""
    
    def test_text_generation(self):
        # NLP-specific tests
        pass
```

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Effort | Priority |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical Infrastructure | 3 weeks | High | P0 |
| Testing & Quality | 2 weeks | Medium | P0 |
| Operations & Monitoring | 2 weeks | Medium | P1 |
| Enterprise Features | 2 weeks | High | P1 |
| **Total** | **9 weeks** | **High** | - |

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of Reusing Tabular Infrastructure
1. **Time Savings**: 60-70% reduction in development time
2. **Quality**: Leverage battle-tested code
3. **Consistency**: Uniform architecture across modules
4. **Maintenance**: Shared infrastructure reduces maintenance burden

### Investment Required
1. **Development**: 2-3 developers for 9 weeks
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
3. **Documentation**: Update all docs
4. **Training**: Team familiarization with Tabular patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create a unified infrastructure library shared between Tabular and TextNLP
   - Start with cloud provider implementations
   - Implement authentication system

2. **Short-term Goals** (1-2 months)
   - Achieve feature parity with Tabular for infrastructure
   - Complete test coverage
   - Deploy to production pilot

3. **Long-term Vision** (3-6 months)
   - Merge common infrastructure into shared library
   - Optimize for NLP-specific workloads
   - Build advanced NLP features on solid foundation

## Conclusion

While TextNLP has strong NLP-specific features and GPU optimization, it lacks the production-ready infrastructure that Tabular has developed. By systematically implementing the missing components and reusing Tabular's proven patterns, TextNLP can achieve production readiness in approximately 9 weeks. The investment will result in a robust, scalable, and maintainable NLP synthetic data platform that matches Tabular's maturity level while maintaining its unique NLP capabilities.
