- **Streaming**: Server-sent events and WebSocket support
- **Caching**: Result caching with tier-specific policies

### ✅ 4. Database Schema and Migrations

Created `tabular/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` with:

- **Common Tables**: Users, organizations, API keys, service usage, billing
- **Tabular Tables**: Generation jobs, validation jobs, dataset profiles
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for all tables
- **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates
- **Constraints**: Foreign keys and data integrity

Created `tabular/run_migration.py`:
- Automated migration runner
- Schema validation
- Connection testing
- Error handling and rollback

### ✅ 5. Service Migration Tools

Created `tabular/switch_to_unified.py`:
- Switches between legacy and unified versions
- Backup and restore functionality
- Status checking and environment validation
- Easy rollback capabilities

Created `tabular/test_unified_integration.py`:
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Component-wise testing
- Environment validation
- API application testing

### ✅ 6. Updated Main Application

Updated `tabular/api/app.py`:
- Now imports from unified infrastructure version
- Legacy version backed up as `app_legacy.py`
- Clean switch between implementations
- Backward compatibility maintained

uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 4. Verification
```bash
# Test the integration
python test_unified_integration.py

# Check service status
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/ready
```

## Rollback Procedure

If needed, you can easily rollback to the legacy version:

```bash
cd tabular/
python switch_to_unified.py --revert
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Helm charts and operators
2. **Multi-Cloud**: Terraform modules for AWS, Azure, GCP
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Custom dashboards and alerts
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and CDN integration
5. **Security Hardening**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Conclusion

The tabular service migration to unified infrastructure is **COMPLETE** and ready for production deployment. The service now has:

- ✅ **Enterprise-grade architecture** with multi-tenancy
- ✅ **Commercial viability** with tier-based pricing
- ✅ **Operational excellence** with monitoring and logging
- ✅ **Scalability** with auto-scaling and load balancing
- ✅ **Security** with authentication and authorization
- ✅ **Developer experience** with consistent APIs

The migration provides a solid foundation for scaling the Inferloop platform and can serve as a template for migrating other services (textnlp, syndocs, etc.) to the unified infrastructure.
